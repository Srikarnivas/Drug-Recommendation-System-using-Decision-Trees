# Drug-Recommendation-System-using-Decision-Trees

This project implements a decision tree classifier to recommend suitable medications for patients based on their demographic and health data. 
The dataset contains information about patients' age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, along with the medication they responded to. 
By training a decision tree on this dataset, the model can predict the appropriate medication for new patients with similar characteristics. 
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction functionalities.
